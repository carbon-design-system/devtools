/*
    as of right I can't be 100% sure I'm getting the correct token here on the
    theme side, but here are the steps I'm taking to make an educated guess.
    
    IDL Color Token (100%)
    1. search all IDL tokens until I find a match
    
    Carbon Theme
    0. only execute search if idl color is found first
    1. check target and see if it has custom properties, and grab the
       used theme based on some checks around the unique list of keys.
       search based on that single theme if found.
    2. search through all themes if no active theme is found.
    3. scope tokens checked for based on types (e.g. type, background, border, icon)
    4. if a unique token is match, grab it's theme, and reorder the master list too
       prioritize that going forward. The thought process here is in general most pages use a single theme.
       If a theme has been identified then we can assume the next element will have a high chance it's using
       that same theme.
